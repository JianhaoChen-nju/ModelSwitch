Since Jane was born on the last day of February in the year 2000, her birthdate is February 29, 2000, because 2000 is a leap year.\n\nJane is 16 years old today. Since she was born in a leap year, we can determine her age based on if today is also a leap day, but it's not necessary because her birthday will be on March 1 in non-leap years. Today is her 16-year birthday. \n\nLeap years are every 4 years, but years ending in 00 must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Therefore, we consider the leap years in this sequence: 2000 (leap year), 2004 (leap year), 2008 (leap year), 2012 (leap year), 2016 (leap year). But in 2020, the year she turned 20 (leap year), it is certain that she had her birthday on 02/29 by this point.\n\nThis year would have to be greater than 2016 because she turned 16.  The next leap year that could possibly be a year that she turned 16 would be 2024. We'll test this. If she turned 16 on 2024 then the equation is (2024-2000) = 24. Since 24 / 4 = 6, we have to look at the problem more closely since 2004 was also a leap year which would make her birthday be on March 1 that year and also make the equation above be off by a year. We need (2024 - 4 years) to be the last leap year or 2020. Then back track to her 19th birthday in 2019 or non leap year and that makes February, 28 2019 the 19th birthday, the math matches but doesn't make a 16 year old by 2024 so we'll have another leap year.\n\nLet's try 2020. If her birthday was on 2/29 this year, that can't be 16 because this year she turned 20.\n\nThe next leap year is 2020. We have to test 2016 then 2000 to see if either can create a 16-year-old Jane.

Jane started work in 2016, and today is her 3-year work anniversary. This means it must be 2019.\n\nSince it's her 3-year anniversary, if we know the exact date she started is near our current date but in 2016, we can use the information about the second day to establish the first day. Jane remembers spilling coffee on her second day which was December 2, which would make her first day at work December 1, 2016.\n\nHer 3-year anniversary would be December 1, 2019.\n\nThe question then asks for the date a month ago. From December 1, 2019, one month prior would be November 1, 2019.\n\nThe answer to this question is \\boxed{11/01/2019}."
