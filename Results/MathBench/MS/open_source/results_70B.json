So now we have 4899/994 - 4 - 6/7.\n\n4. Combine the whole numbers with fractions: -4 + 4899/994 - 6/7.\n   To do this, we'll find a common denominator for the whole number and fractions.\n\n   Since we're dealing with 994 and 7, the least common multiple (LCM) is not straightforward. We can rewrite -4 as a fraction using either 994 or 7:\n   -4 can be rewritten as -3968/994 (because 994 * -4 = -3968) or -28/7.\n\n5. We now have two methods to calculate this:\n   Method 1: Combine -3968/994 with 4899/994:\n   This will give us (4899 - 3968)/994 = 931/994.\n\n   Then subtract 6/7:\n   We can find the LCM for 994 and 7: Since 994 = 142 * 7, we'll rewrite both fractions:\n   (931 * 7)/(994 * 7) - (6 * 142)/(994 * 7) = 6517/138 - 852/138 = 5665/138\n   5665/138 seems difficult to reduce.\n\n   Since our initial goal was to answer in simplest fraction form, let's look for alternatives to simplify.\n\n6. Alternative (using a common denominator and calculating the fractions with actual values):\n   We know that the common denominator for fractions is indeed 138. However, rewriting the original whole number may help simplify the problem. \n   Thus, converting the whole numbers and fractions: 4899/994 can stay the same, and rewrite other numbers over the common denominator of 138 for further calculations:\n   Using decimals can help simplify large fraction combinations for alternative understanding.\n   \n   Since we have hit the complexity limitation, calculating the numbers further down will return the decimal value of approximately 4.097 (to calculate this we convert 4899/994 = 4.926, -4 = -4, -6/7 = -0.8571 and combining these to obtain our"
